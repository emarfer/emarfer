<H1> ¿How I got here?</H1>
<p>I decided to study SQL (MySQL) after years of working with databases in different call centres, I was curious to know how they were built and  how they could be improved. 
During these years I also worked at home with ACCESS and EXCEL in a self-taught way.
My interest in the wide world of DATA also comes from studying all the reports that were given to me, as a teleoperator, from the B.I. department in EXCEL, which made me recover my high school statistics books.
As co-manager of the KOMOREBI bookshop, I relied on MS OFFICE for order tracking, accounting and studying the needs of the business.
I left it all to learn DATA ANALYTICS at IRONHACK, so now I am also totally interested in PYTHON.
My goal as an employee is to continue learning on the job and to develop my broad skills in data analysis.</p>
